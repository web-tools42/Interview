• Why is looking at runtime not a reliable method of calculating time complexity?

• Not all computers are made equal( some may be stronger and therefore boost our runtime speed )

• How many background processes ran concurrently with our program that was being tested?

• We also need to ask if our code remains performant if we increase the size of the input.

• The real question we need to answering is: How does our performance scale?.
