We do not charge any fee for employment and the same applies to the Recruitment Partners who we work with. Amazon is an equal opportunity employer. Employment decisions are based on merit. Additionally, we do not ask for any refundable security deposit to be paid in bank accounts for employment purposes. We request candidates to be cautious of misleading communications and not pay any fee/ deposit to individuals/ agencies/ employment portals on the pretext of attending Amazon interview process or seeking employment with us. These would be fraudulent in nature. Anyone dealing with such individuals/ agencies / employment portals will be doing so at his/her own risk and Amazon will not be held responsible for such loss or damage suffered directly or indirectly. Such fake job offers and appointment letters shall not be treated as any kind of offer or representation by Amazon. Please note, Amazon does not send offer letters from Hotmail, Yahoo, Gmail or any other public email accounts or demand a fee in lieu of an employment offer / interview. If you receive such e-mails, please do not pay any fee or deposit. We request that you report such offers to recruiting-feedback@amazon.com. If you have already made a payment, please log a complaint with the local police for necessary legal action to be taken.

#### How do I determine if I am restricted from seeking employment or having employment discussions with Amazon or its subsidiaries?

You may be restricted from having employment discussions with Amazon or its subsidiaries if you are currently participating, or previously participated, in government acquisition or other matters involving Amazon or its subsidiaries. To learn how the rules apply to your specific situation, please consult your employer’s ethics officer.

#### I am a government employee working on a procurement involving a large government contract. One of the competitors for the contract is Amazon. May I apply for a job opening with Amazon?

Certain government employees who work on procurements for government contracts are required to file a written disqualification memorandum if the employee commences to seek employment. According to the U.S. Federal Government rules, the employee is also required to provide written notice of employment contacts even if the employee or contractor rejects the possibility of employment. Please consult your employer’s ethics officer for advice on your specific situation.

#### I formerly worked for a current government customer of Amazon and while there I served as a technical advisor overseeing decisions concerning one of Amazon’s contracts. If employed by Amazon, could I meet with employees of my former Federal Government agency to discuss issues pertaining to the Amazon contract?

You may not meet with employees of the government client to discuss the contract with which you were closely involved during your time with the government. Please consult your employer’s ethics officer for advice on your specific situation.

#### Do the government restrictions on seeking employment apply to merely sending my resume to Amazon?

The U.S. Federal Government restrictions on seeking outside employment apply broadly to include contacting prospective employers about possible employment. This includes sending resumes to a prospective employer.

#### What do I need to know if I am a government employee?

Notice to current government employees: Certain laws and regulations place restrictions on employment discussions between government employees and non-government entities. Before proceeding further, please review the following FAQ’s pertaining to current government employment. By proceeding to engage in any employment discussions with Amazon.com and/or any of its subsidiaries, you are representing that you have confirmed with your employer or through other reasonable inquiry that you are permitted to engage in such discussions under the applicable laws and regulations.

#### What do I do if I suspect a fraudulent source is offering me a job at Amazon?

Please be cautious of common scams that offer unauthorized Amazon employment opportunities. Our recruiters who contact candidates — whether it be via text, call, or email—will never ask for banking information, or request an enrollment fee. We encourage those who think they may have been contacted by a fraudulent source offering a job on behalf of Amazon to report it via [http://www.amazondelivers.jobs/contactus](http://www.amazondelivers.jobs/contactus). We actively investigate reported employment scams, and as a result, dozens of fraudulent recruiting websites have been taken down.

## Software development topics | Amazon.jobs

> ### Excerpt
>
> Before you dig into the technical topics you may be asked about during your interview, connect with your recruiting point of contact to understand the subjects/skills you’ll most likely be discussing and demonstrating. In general, our technical interviews typically require you to perform coding and system design white boarding exercises. Also keep in mind that invention is in our DNA, and technology is the fundamental tool we wield to evolve and improve every aspect of the experience we provide our customers. When reviewing the below topics, keep the customer top of mind.

An important part of Amazon’s Software Development Engineer hiring process is the completion of an online assessment which includes a coding test. We invite you to prepare for the experience by taking this sample coding challenge. You can become comfortable with the environment and experience practice questions which are similar to the actual assessment. You can click through this as many times as you’d like!

Interviewing for a software engineer role that requires at least 2 years of experience? Learn how to successfully demonstrate your skills in interviews.

Technical topics

Programming language

We do not require that you know any specific programming language before interviewing for a tech position. However, familiarity with a prominent language is generally a prerequisite for success. You should be familiar with the syntax of languages such as C, C++, C++14, C#, Go, Java7, Java8, JavaScript, Kotlin, Objective-C, PyPy2, PyPy3, Python2, Python3, Ruby, Scala and Swift. You should also know some of the languages’ nuances, such as how memory management works, or the most commonly used collections, libraries, etc.

Data structures

Most of the work we do involves storing and providing access to data in efficient ways. This requires a strong background in data structures. You’ll need to understand the inner workings of common data structures and be able to compare and contrast their usage in various applications. You will be expected to know the runtimes for common operations as well as how they use memory.

Algorithms

Your interview will not be focused on rote memorization of algorithms. However, having a good understanding of the most common algorithms will likely make solving some of the questions a lot easier. Consider reviewing common algorithms such as traversals, divide and conquer, breadth-first search vs. depth-first search and understand the tradeoffs for each. Knowing the runtimes, theoretical limitations, and basic implementation strategies of different classes of algorithms is more important than memorizing the specific details of any given algorithm.

Coding

Expect to be asked to write syntactically correct code—no pseudo code. If you feel a bit rusty coding without an IDE or coding in a specific language, it’s a good idea to dust off the cobwebs and get comfortable coding with a pen and paper. The most important thing a Software Development Engineer does at Amazon is write scalable, robust, and well-tested code. These are the main evaluation criteria for your code. Make sure that you check for edge cases and validate that no bad input can slip through. This is your chance to show off your coding ability.

Object-oriented design

Good design is paramount to extensible, bug-free, long-lived code. We know it’s possible to solve any given software problem in almost limitless ways, but when software needs to be extensible and maintainable, good software design is critical to success. One way to build lasting software is to use object-oriented design best practices. You should have a working knowledge of a few common and useful design patterns, along with how to write software in an object-oriented way. You likely won’t be asked to describe the details of how specific design patterns work, but expect to have to defend your design choices.

Databases

Most of the software that we write is backed by a data store. Many of the challenges tech people face arise when figuring out how to most efficiently retrieve and store data for future use. Amazon has been at the forefront of the non-relational DB movement. We have made Amazon Web Services such as DynamoDB available to the developer community so that they can easily leverage the benefits of non-relational databases. While we don't expect any particular level of expertise with non-relational databases, you should be familiar with broad database concepts and their applications. The more you know about tradeoffs between relational and non-relational databases, the better prepared you will be.

Distributed computing

Systems at Amazon have to work under very strict tolerances at a high load. While we have some internal tools that help us with scaling, it’s important to have an understanding of a few basic distributed computing concepts. Understanding topics such as service-oriented architectures, map-reduce, distributed caching, load balancing, and others, will help you formulate answers to some of the more complicated distributed architecture questions you might encounter.

Operating systems

You won’t need to know how to build your own operating system from scratch, but you should be familiar with some OS topics that can affect code performance (e.g. memory management, processes, threads, synchronization, paging, and multithreading).

Internet topics

We expect our engineers to be familiar with the fundamentals of how the internet works. Brush up on how browsers function at a high level, from DNS lookups and TCP/IP, to socket connections. Having a solid understanding of the fundamentals of how the worldwide web works is a requirement.

General machine learning and artificial intelligence

Expect to be asked about data-driven modeling, train/test protocols, error analysis, and statistical significance. For example, given a problem definition, you should be able to formulate it as a machine learning problem and propose a solution, including ideas for data sources, annotation, modeling approaches, and potential pitfalls. Understand the basic AI/ML methods and algorithms – revisit your favorite ML and AI textbooks.

&#x20;

We understand this was a relatively long list of topics to review. Know that your interviewers won’t be evaluating your ability to memorize all of the details for each of these topics. They will be looking for your ability to apply what you know to solve problems efficiently and effectively. With (sometimes) limited time to prepare for a technical interview, we recommend reviewing computer science fundamentals and practicing coding outside of an integrated development environment. This will likely yield the best results for your time. &#x20;

Your interview at Amazon will connect you with members of our Software Development community. They’re there to have a conversation around your experiences and skills in several areas critical to SDE success at Amazon. These areas are a combination of Leadership Principles and technical competencies called SDE Interview Competencies.

Each interviewer is responsible for focusing the conversation on a few (\~2-3) SDE Interview Competencies. In some cases they will ask multiple questions for each competency.&#x20;

Select the tabs for a brief description of the interview competencies. Later in this guide, we’ll get into the details of each competency and how best to showcase your skills in each area.

[TECHNICAL SKILLS](https://duaa2xs5z3ldn.cloudfront.net/index.html#)[LEADERSHIP PRINCIPLES](https://duaa2xs5z3ldn.cloudfront.net/index.html#)

**System design competency**

You should have a working knowledge of a few common and useful design patterns, along with how to write software in an object-oriented way. You likely won’t be asked to describe the details of how specific design patterns work, but expect to apply concepts to the particular problem and defend your design choices.

\

**Three coding competencies**

This is your chance to show off your knowledge and understanding of computer science fundamentals (e.g., hash maps, arrays, binary trees, algorithms). Your evaluation will include three areas of coding: data structures and algorithms, logical and maintainable, and problem-solving.&#x20;

\

While this guide covers each coding competency individually, your response should consider all three as an integrated approach. In other words, when you're responding to a coding question, you should always consider data structures and algorithms, logical and maintainable, and problem-solving together in your approach to solve the problem.
